## Drawing Insights from Reddit Submissions dataset Using ML Algorithms

Conducted data analysis of Reddit posts to identify user engagement and behavior patterns, leveraging data cleaning, transformation, and visualization using Pandas and Matplotlib.

Analyzed post titles and comments to identify common topics and user sentiments, and created visualizations to illustrate trends in user engagement and behavior

### Introduction:
In the digital age, platforms like Reddit have become the epicenter of discourse, news, and content sharing. Serving as a blend of social news aggregation and discussion, Reddit enables users to curate content, categorize them into niche communities termed as "subreddits," and drive engagement through upvotes and downvotes.

### Objective:
As the world increasingly leans on platforms like Reddit, there's a burgeoning need to understand user engagement patterns, content preferences, and predict success metrics. This project encapsulates:

Unraveling patterns of user engagement based on various features like time, post titles, and more.
Predicting post scores, comments, and overall engagement leveraging data-driven models.
Offering granular insights into factors governing the success of a Reddit post.
Analysis and Methodology:
Inputs: The comprehensive dataset encompasses over 132,000 Reddit posts, encompassing features like submission timings, title specifics, upvotes, downvotes, and comment dynamics.

### Training Modules:
Dataset Dynamics: The dataset, analogous to other social media datasets, is subjected to rigorous preprocessing, ensuring it's primed for analysis and modeling.

Testing Metrics: The models, post-training, are subjected to a battery of tests to determine their accuracy, precision, recall, and overall reliability.

### Results and Observations:
The project wielded several machine learning and text classification models, each shedding light on different facets of Reddit:

Engagement spikes were observed around 9 am and 1 pm.
Warmer months showed decreased activity, with engagement surging in colder months.
Post success showed positive correlation with weekends.
An inverse relationship between title length and post engagement was deduced.

### Conclusions and Recommendations:
The Reddit Engagement Analysis provides a treasure trove of insights into the modern digital user's behavior. While the models employed offer a substantial accuracy rate, the unpredictable nature of user behavior and the evolving landscape of content creation must be acknowledged. Future endeavors should aim at real-time data analysis, delve deeper into user psychographics, and seek to incorporate evolving content formats like videos and interactive polls.
