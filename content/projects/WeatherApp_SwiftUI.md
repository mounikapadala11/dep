## Description
Developed an independent iOS app using SwiftUI, focusing on enhancing app performance and user experience through advanced SwiftUI techniques.

### Introduction:
WeatherApp is an iOS application developed using SwiftUI, showcasing modern app development practices. The project emphasized mastering SwiftUI features such as sub-view extraction and efficient use of View structs to create a responsive and data-driven user interface.

### Objective:
The primary goals of the WeatherApp project were:

To build an intuitive and high-performance weather application using SwiftUI.
To implement advanced SwiftUI concepts for optimizing UI/UX.
To demonstrate the capability of SwiftUI in handling complex UI layouts and data-driven designs.

### Analysis and Methodology:
Key aspects of the project included:
Sub-View Extraction: Implementing reusability and better organization in SwiftUI code by extracting sub-views.
ZStack Limitation Handling: Addressing the limitation of SwiftUI's ZStack, which can hold a maximum of 11 elements.
Reusable Components: Creating modular and reusable components for consistent UI elements across different app pages.
Modifier Order Importance: Understanding the significance of the order of modifiers in SwiftUI and its impact on the view hierarchy and layout.
Efficiency of View Structs: Utilizing SwiftUI's lightweight and efficient View structs, designed for frequent creation and destruction.

### Technical Highlights:
Data-Driven UI: Employing SwiftUI's data-driven approach to update UI elements dynamically based on data state changes.
View Tree Comparison and Selective Rendering: Enhancing performance by comparing view trees and selectively rendering views impacted by data changes.
Consistent View Trees: Declaring all UI possibilities upfront for SwiftUI to effectively navigate and update the appropriate views on data changes.

### Results and Observations:
The WeatherApp demonstrated a high level of efficiency in rendering complex UI layouts and responding to dynamic data changes. The use of advanced SwiftUI techniques led to a significant improvement in app performance and user experience.

### Conclusions and Future Directions:
The WeatherApp project not only highlights the capabilities of SwiftUI in modern iOS app development but also provides a foundation for future projects that demand high-performance and dynamic UIs. Continuous exploration of SwiftUI's features and integration with real-time data will be the next steps in evolving this application.

<!-- Natural disasters like earthquakes and landslides are sudden events that cause widespread destruction and major collateral damage including loss of life. Though disasters can never be prevented, their effects on mankind can surely be reduced. In this paper, we present the design and control of SRR (Search and Reconnaissance Robot), a robot capable of traversing on all terrains and locating survivors stuck under the debris. This will assist the rescue team to focus on recovering the victims, leaving the locating task for the Robots. The unique features of the SRR above existing ATVs are active-articulation, modularity, and assisted-autonomy. Active-articulation allows the SRR to climb objects much tall than itself. Modularity allows the SRR to detach into smaller modules to enter tight spaces where the whole body canâ€™t fit. Assisted-autonomy allows the SRR to detect the presence of objects in front and climb autonomously over them.
