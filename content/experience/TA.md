## Description


At UCSD, As a Teaching Assistant, I had the oppurtunity to work with a team of 15 dedicated tutors, meticulously worked across four specialized sub-teams: Logistics, Grading, Assignments, and Exams. Each sub-team played a pivotal role in managing a class of 250 eager students.

Furthermore, I initiated structured workflows, mapping out clear responsibilities for each sub-team. For example, the Logistics team was entrusted with ensuring that resources, from class materials to technology, were available on schedule. Simultaneously, the Grading team was given rigorous guidelines to maintain fairness and consistency, the Assignments team handled timely distribution and collection of tasks, and the Exams team focused on creating and administering assessments.

This organized approach proved invaluable. Not only did it boost team morale by minimizing confusion and overlap, but it also guaranteed the on-time execution of all academic deliverables. 

The result? A seamless teaching experience, where students always had what they needed when they needed it, ensuring a productive and organized academic environment.

During my internship, I worked under the guidance of Prof. Pratyush Kumar (Assistant Professor, Department of Computer Science, IIT Madras) where I implemented a **Convolutional Neural Network** for **6-DoF Global Pose Regression** and **Odometry Estimation** from consecutive monocular images. The model estimates the camera pose from a sequence of monocular images from the camera. At each step, the model takes two consecutive frames as input and returns the global and relative pose between the two frames. It was built and trained from scratch in **Tensorflow** and it outperformed traditional feature-based visual localization algorithms, especially in texture-less regions. The neural network was later used by Prof. Pratyush for the localization of robots in GPS denied environments.
