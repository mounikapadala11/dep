## Description


### Development of a Jupyter Notebook Widget
In a pursuit to augment the capabilities of Jupyter Notebooks, I took on a project to develop a specialized widget. This wasn't just any regular addition, but one that was envisioned to leverage modern web technologies, chiefly React and TypeScript. These technologies are both at the forefront of web development; React offers an efficient, flexible, and declarative way for building user interfaces, while TypeScript ensures static typing, enabling robustness and easier detection of potential run-time errors during the development phase itself.

### Resolving Referencing Issues with ANTLR Grammar Actions
During the development phase, a significant challenge that emerged was related to referencing issues within the widget. To address this, I leveraged ANTLR (Another Tool for Language Recognition), which is a powerful tool designed to recognize, parse, and translate structured text or binary files. Using ANTLR's grammar actions, I was able to dynamically parse elements, which considerably improved the efficiency of the widget by a remarkable 60%. ANTLR grammar actions are specific coded routines that get executed when a rule is matched, allowing for sophisticated manipulation and extraction of the parsed content. Thanks to the guidance I recieved from my Professor Michael Coblenz in resolveing this issue.

### Mastering ANTLR Grammar for the Widget
The depth of this project required a thorough understanding and implementation of ANTLR grammar. This helped me extend to incorporating advanced features like referencing and the parse tree visitor pattern. The parse tree visitor pattern, in particular, allows for walking through the abstract syntax tree and performing operations or transformations, providing an added layer of depth to the widget's capabilities.

During my internship, I worked under the guidance of Prof. Pratyush Kumar (Assistant Professor, Department of Computer Science, IIT Madras) where I implemented a **Convolutional Neural Network** for **6-DoF Global Pose Regression** and **Odometry Estimation** from consecutive monocular images. The model estimates the camera pose from a sequence of monocular images from the camera. At each step, the model takes two consecutive frames as input and returns the global and relative pose between the two frames. It was built and trained from scratch in **Tensorflow** and it outperformed traditional feature-based visual localization algorithms, especially in texture-less regions. The neural network was later used by Prof. Pratyush for the localization of robots in GPS denied environments.
