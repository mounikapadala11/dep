    subtitle: " Hello 👋! I'm **Mounika**. My tech journey began at **Vardhaman College** in Hyderabad 🇮🇳, where I not only honed my foundational skills but also emerged as a **Best Achiever in Computer Science & Engineering** 🎓. 

Fast forward, and I found myself expanding my horizons at the [**University of California**](https://cse.ucsd.edu/graduate/degree-programs/ms-program), San Diego, pursuing an **MSc in Computer Science** 🌴.





At present, I'm a **Graduate Student Researcher at UCSD** 🎓. As a crucial component of my research, I'm contributing to the development of a **Jupyter Notebook widget**, or GUI, envisioned to be a game-changer for data scientists 💡. 
    
    
    
    
    
 From orchestrating advanced web applications using the **MERN Stack** to delving into the intricacies of **Network Programming with GoLang**, I'm always on the move, chasing knowledge 🚀. My expertise spans languages like **Python, C, and C++**, and my latest adventure has been exploring **Apache NIFI** 🌐. 


<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>


Beyond the academics, I've marked milestones with **published papers** in esteemed journals 📚 and invaluable **hands-on experience as a software engineer** 💼. In my downtime from the tech world, I enjoy doing **Aerial Silks** 🎪, finding balance between the digital and the physical.



<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

Driven by a profound passion for tech and an aspiration for continuous learning, I'm keenly interested in opportunities in **software development and data science** 💡. Whether you're curious about my projects, want to discuss the latest in tech, or wish to hear more about my journey from Hyderabad to San Diego, let's connect! 🤝"
